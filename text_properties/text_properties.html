    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as
        the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for
        an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
        adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a
        hen.[11][12]

        Other terms are:

        Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[13][14]
        Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
        Chick: a young chicken[15]
        Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[16]
        Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[17]
        Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[18]
        Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[19] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
        immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[20]
        Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[21]
        Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, chicken as
        a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[22][page needed][failed verification]

        Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[23]

    <h2>General Biology and Habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even
        animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.[30]
        The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[31] The world's oldest known chicken lived
        16 years according to Guinness World Records.[32]

    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
    <h3>Social Behaviour</h3>
    <p>
        Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
        eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking order',
        with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from
        a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
        hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[34]

    <h4>Vocializations</h4>
    <p>
        When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as
        well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their
        chicks and encourage them to eat.

        A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[35]
        However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.

        Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls
        when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[36]
